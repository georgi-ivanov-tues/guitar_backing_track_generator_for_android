Playing:
Please make sure that you have the Youtube application installed on your phone before you start playing.

Recording:
Keep in mind that if the volume of the speakers is too high you won't be able to hear your playing on the
recording. That's why we recommend using external speakers in order to get a full and better 
sounding recording and/or turning the volume down.
